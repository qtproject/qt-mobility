  \class QOrganizerTodoOccurrence
  \brief The QOrganizerTodoOccurrence class provides an occurrence of a task which should be completed
  \inmodule QtOrganizer
  \ingroup organizer-items
  \since 1.1

  A todo occurrence is a specific instance of a todo item.  An occurrence
  which is retrieved from a manager may not actually be persisted in that
  manager (for example, it may be generated automatically from the
  recurrence rule of the parent todo stored in the manager), in which case
  it will have a zero-id and differ from the parent todo only in its start
  date.  Alternatively, it may be persisted in the manager (that is, the
  client has saved the occurrence previously) where it is stored as an exception
  to its parent todo.
