/*!
    \class QMediaService
    \brief The QMediaService class provides a common base class for media
    service implementations.
    \ingroup multimedia
    \preliminary

    Media services provide implementations of the functionality promised
    by media objects, and allow multiple providers to implement a QMediaObject.

    To provide the functionality of a QMediaObject media services implement
    QMediaControl interfaces.  Services typically implement one core media
    control which provides the core feature of a media object, and some
    number of additional controls which provide either optional features of
    the media object, or features of a secondary media object or peripheral
    object.

    A pointer to media service's QMediaControl implementation can be obtained
    by passing the control's interface name to the requestControl() function.

    \code
    QMediaPlayerControl *control = qobject_cast<QMediaPlayerControl *>(
            service->requestControl("com.nokia.Qt.QMediaPlayerControl/1.0"));
    \endcode

    Media objects can use services loaded dynamically from plug-ins or
    implemented statically within an applications.  Plug-in based services
    should also implement the QMediaServiceProviderPlugin interface.  Static
    services should implement the QMediaServiceProvider interface.
