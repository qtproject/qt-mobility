    \brief The QMessageDataComparator namespace contains types used in specifying the comparison
    of MessageStore objects with user-defined values.
*/

/*!
    \enum QMessageDataComparator::EqualityComparator

    Defines the comparison operations that can be used to compare data elements 
    of QMessageManager objects for equality and inequality.

    \value Equal Represents the '==' operator.
    \value NotEqual Represents the '!=' operator.

/*!
    \enum QMessageDataComparator::InclusionComparator

    Defines the comparison operations that can be used to compare data elements 
    of QMessageManager objects for inclusion or exclusion.

    \value Includes Represents an operation in which an associated property is tested to 
                    determine whether it includes a value.
    \value Excludes Represents an operation in which an associated property is tested to 
                    determine whether it is equal to the supplied value.

/*!
    \enum QMessageDataComparator::RelationComparator

    Defines the comparison operations that can be used to compare data elements 
    of QMessageManager objects, according to a specific relation.

    \value LessThan Represents the '<' operator.
    \value LessThanEqual Represents the '<=' operator.
    \value GreaterThan Represents the '>' operator.
    \value GreaterThanEqual Represents the '>= operator'.
