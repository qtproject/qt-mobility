\section1 How to register and unregister service plugins in S60?

Registration phase is a little different compared to other platforms because of the
authenticity of the provider is done during (un)registering phase based on the verification 
of VID/SID (vendor ID or secure ID). A tiny installer application must be implemented 
by the service provider. Installer application is responsible for the registering (and the unregistering) 
of the service. The example code for the installer is shown below. The whole installer project can be found under 
\c {examples/serviceinstaller_sfw_symbian}.

\snippet examples/serviceinstaller_sfw_symbian/exampleinstaller/exampleinstaller.cpp 0

If you want to create your own installer take a copy from the installer project (\c {examples/serviceinstaller_sfw_symbian})
and modify only the necessary parts e.g a target for your installer and define plugins which are deployed etc.

If the installer defines the VID (non-zero value) then the VID is stored to the database, otherwise SID is used.
When unregistering the plugin the VID/SID verification is done to ensure that only the application which actually
registered the service is only allowed to remove it. VID/SID is left to the database even the service has been
unregistered. This prevents the exactly same way named services to be installed afterwards because the VID/SID
information is locked to the service name.

More info about VID and SID can be found from:

\endlist


\section1 What's special from the security perspective?

There is only one database in S60 because both databases (user and system) are combined to the same database.
The database is located behind the server's private folder, (\c{c:\private\E3b48c24}). This ensures the database can't
be thumbered (e.g. remove, move or replace) without Allfiles capability which isn't user-grantable (More about the
capabilities: \l http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Capabilities). That makes it impossible for example to replace the
whole database with the new one which might contain malicious services.

Note! It doesn't matter which scope is used on Symbian as \l {QService::UserScope} and \l {QService::SystemScope}
are mapped to the same database.

\section1 Directory structure

There are different implementations for the both emulator and device because emulator doesn't support multiple
applications to be loaded at the same time, (Known issue: \l {http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-2950}{QTBUG-2950}).
The dll approach must be used in the emulator environment and the exe approach instead of dll in the real device.

Note! The greatest part of the S60 specific code is located under the symbian folder in a directory hierarchy of
Service FW. ServiceDatabase class contains also S60 specific code and the DatabaseManager class has been replaced
totally with the corresponding class.
