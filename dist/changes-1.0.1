New features
------

 - MOBILITY-991: Translation file support added

Other changes/optimizations
------

 - QTMOBILITY-50, QTMOBILITY-264, MOBILITY-971 fixed: various configure -prefix bugs fixed
 - configure tests on Symbian are based on arm builds (rather than winscw)
 - MOBILITY-908 fixed: -plugindir parameter added to configure.[sh|bat]
 - plugin project files simplified
 - MOBILITY-717 fixed: plug-in loading across all API's using plug-ins unified
   and fixed. This includes addition of PREFIX/plugins to standard plugin
   path lookup.

****************************************************************************
*                   Important Behavior Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

 - building of Mobility requires "make install" step as binaries
   such as plug-ins and examples are not automatically deployed to BUILDDIR/plugins,
   BUILDDIR/bin or BUILDDIR/bin/examples anymore. Rpath values have been
   adjusted accordingly.

QtMedia/QtMultimediaKit
------

 - The QtMedia library has been merged with the QtMultimediaKit library from Qt.
   The new QtMultimediaKit library in QtMobility replaces both the QtMedia libary
   from QtMobility and the QtMultimedia library from Qt.

 - Meta-data related API changes
     * Meta-data on QMediaObject is now read-only.  The isWritable(), 
       setMetaData() and setExtendedMetaData() function have been removed.
     * The meta-data editing functions removed from QMediaObject have been
       added to QMediaRecorder. 
     * QMetaDataControl has been split into two controls, the read-only
       QMetaDataReaderControl and the writable QMetaDataWriterControl.
 - Media Service API changes.
     * The API for requesting a control from a QMediaService has been split
       into request and release steps, allowing services to allocate and
       release resources on demand.  This removes the QMediaService
       control() function and adds requestControl(), and releaseControl().

QtPublishSubscribe
------


QtSensors
------
 - Bug fixes
    * correct cubehouse example to avoid extreem camera angle being used.
 - Added support for Symbian 3.2 and newer devices using the Symbian Sensor
   Framework.
 - Fixed rotation definition to be -90 < X < 90 so that the complete range of
   motion can be represented.
 - Corrected the rotation definition for the Z axis (it starts from the Y axis,
   not the X axis).
 - Clarify that the tap sensor cannot report on single and double tap events at
   the same time.
 - Remove the need for new sensor types to include qsensor_p.h. Note that this
   breaks forwards binary compatibility (a sensor type built against 1.0.1 will
   cause a crash when run against 1.0.0).
 - Backends should no longer set a data rate and should treat the default (0)
   as "app does not care".
 - Backends should no longer set an output range and should treat the default
   (-1) as "app does not care".
 - Binary compatibility broke on Symbian emulator (WINSCW) and most likely on
   Windows too (but not on Linux). This was due to the addition of extra const
   modifiers to the ::type members on QSensor sub-classes. This change was made
   to address a crash on Symbian caused by applications getting uninitialized
   pointers.

QtServiceFramework

 - MOBILITY-873 fixed: default interface documentation improved
